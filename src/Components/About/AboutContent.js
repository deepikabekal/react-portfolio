            <p> Hello! I'm Deepika Bekal, a Full Stack Developer and a Software Test Analyst </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about web development and keenly interested in working on building my own website. I developed an interest in programming during my stint at one of the big 4 consulting firms. I decided to pursue my passion for web development by enrolling in a Bootcamp for Full Stack web development at University of Toronto School of Continuining Studies and engaging in several hours of online training using extensive resources that were avaialble online.The program offered several opportunities to engage in projects which provided a great hands-on learning experience for honing my technical as well team building skills. I got an insight into the agile methodology by collaborating in teams and completing several critical projects with tight deadlines.

            <p>                
            I expect to complete the program in June 2021 and continue to build on various tools that I have been introduced to in the Bootcamp such as React , NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, Git, Javascript and so on.
